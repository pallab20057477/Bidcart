enum NotificationTypes {

## 🚀 How It Works

### Broadcast Notifications (ALL USERS):
- Auction Started
- Auction Starting Soon

These use `recipients: []` (empty array) which means broadcast to everyone.

### Targeted Notifications:
- Outbid Alert → Specific user
- Bid Placed → Specific user
- First Bid → Vendor only
- Auction Ended → Vendor only
- Ending Soon → All bidders
